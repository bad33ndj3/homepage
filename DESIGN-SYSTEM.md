# Arctic Future Design Book

A cold, minimal, futuristic visual identity designed for a personal productivity homepage. Focused purely on design principles—no implementation details.

---

## 1. Visual Identity Overview

The Arctic Future theme is defined by:

- A cold, crisp color palette.
- Clean, minimal surfaces with frosted glass layers.
- Subtle futuristic accents.
- Strong visual hierarchy through spacing and type.
- Rounded geometry that feels modern but not playful.
- Command palette and cards share the same frosted shell for cohesion.

The goal is a dashboard that feels fast, calm, and intentional.

- Card Radius: `14px`

Rounded, but not soft or playful—precise, modern curvature.

## 4. Typography

A crisp, futuristic type system using Inter or SF Pro.

### Type Sizes

- Large Time: `32–36px`
- Weather Temperature: `24–26px`
- Card Titles: `18–20px`
- Body: `15–16px`
- Muted Meta: `13px`

### Weights

- Bold: Only for the time or rare emphasis.
- Medium: Card titles.
- Regular: Body text.
- Light: Secondary details.

Minimal contrast in fonts; clean hierarchy.

---

## 5. Spacing System

Consistent scale for a futuristic minimal feel:

`4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32`

- Cards: `20px`
- Section spacing: `24px`
- Grid gaps: `16–20px`
- Dense elements: `12px`

Whitespace is deliberate and functional.

## 6. Component Aesthetics

### Cards

- Frosted glass surfaces with 12–18px blur and 70–90% opacity.
- Thin borders (light: `#E2E8F0`; dark: `#334155`) with subtle inner stroke optional.
- Soft elevation shadow: `0 12px 35px rgba(15, 23, 42, 0.12)` light, `0 12px 35px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25)` dark.
- Balanced padding.

### Search Input

- Minimal border on frosted base.
- Clean rounded geometry.
- Light accent glow when active; soft blue ring with subtle blur.

### Pinned Link Pills

- Frosted micro-cards with thin border and light blur.
- Minimal shadows.
- Compact, futuristic presence.
- Category tabs inherit accent highlight; tabs are text-first, not heavy pills.

### Weather Summary

- Subtle color cues.
- Small icons.
- Clean temperature typography.
- Glass card with crisp border; avoid heavy background imagery.
- Rain alerts appear as a slim blue strip with concise copy.

### GitLab Sections

- Dense, clear, structured.
- Small badges for status.
- Frosted rows with hover lift and accent border.
- Expandable rows reveal secondary meta (branches, labels, pipeline) without breaking the frosted shell.

## 7. Motion Principles

- Fast transitions: `100–140ms`.
- Subtle movement: `1–2px` lifts.
- Opacity fades for switching content.
- No bouncy or elastic animations.
- Frosted elements keep blur consistent—avoid changing blur on hover.

Futuristic means smooth, quiet micro-interactions.

---

## 8. Light ↔ Dark Mode Philosophy

Both themes:

- Maintain the same geometry, spacing, and typography.
- Shift background and text colors without altering layout.
- Use consistent accent hues for identity.
- Keep weather colors subtle in both modes.

Dark mode should feel like an inverse of light — not a separate theme.

## 9. Overall Mood & Intent

The design communicates:

- Calm focus.
- Precision.
- Efficiency.
- Subtle futuristic aesthetics.
- A cold, clean environment that supports productivity.

This book defines the visual direction and rules to keep the interface cohesive and intentional.
